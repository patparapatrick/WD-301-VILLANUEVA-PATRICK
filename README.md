Background:
  The "DriveSafe Advocacy" seeks to encourage safe driving practices among regular
drivers in order to address the urgent problem of road safety. Road safety advocacy and
education initiatives must be given top priority in light of the growing number of vehicles on the
road, as well as the rise in accidents and fatalities brought on by careless driving practices. We
can make the roads safer for everyone by increasing awareness and encouraging responsible
driving.

Frameworks plus Component:
    DriveSafe Advocacy used Angular Material as a framework with cards and tabs as components to present content effectively. 
  Cards are used because they are flexible in displaying content. While tabs are used for the users can freely choose
  the content they want to see. These two components are used effectively to enhance the visuals and interactions with the user.
